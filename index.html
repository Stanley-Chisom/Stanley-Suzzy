    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
     <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.</p>

    <a href="#" class="nav-link">Javascript and java</a>
     <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.</p>
      <p>in contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values</p>

     <section4 class="main-section" id="hello-world"><h4>Hello world</h4>
     <a href="#" class="nav-link">Hello world</a>
      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
       <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

      <section5 class="main-section" id="variables"><h5>Variables</h5>
      <a href="#" class="nav-link">Variables</a>
       <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
